## Description
This project is a part of Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree program. From the course:
>"This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page."

For this project I used the [starter HTML and CSS](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) files provided by Udacity and transformed this static page into an interactive one.

I implemented the following features/made the following changes:

* The navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list
* When scrolling, current section is highlighted on the page
* When clicking a link, it will scroll smoothly to the right section
* I created "scroll up" button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page
	
## Goals of this project
* Manipulate the DOM
* Dynamically add data to the DOM of an otherwise static site
